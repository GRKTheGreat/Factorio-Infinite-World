Adds an infinite world generation preset to Factorio, perfect for those who want to build without map boundaries. Compatible with both vanilla Factorio and Bob's Mods!

## Features

- **Truly Infinite World**: No more map boundaries to limit your factory expansion
- **Optimized Resource Generation**: Larger, richer resource patches to support mega-bases
- **Reduced Water & Cliffs**: More buildable land while maintaining natural barriers
- **Larger Starting Area**: More room to establish your initial base
- **Bob's Mods Compatibility**: Seamless integration with Bob's Ores and Enemies
- **Performance Conscious**: Uses Factorio's native chunk-based generation

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [Factorio Mod Portal](https://mods.factorio.com/)
2. Place the zip file in your Factorio mods folder

## Bob's Mods Compatibility
